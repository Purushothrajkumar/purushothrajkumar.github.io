  <h1>Your full-stack developer portfolio site should only detail your best projects. This is your opportunity to show recruiters that you have the skills that you’ve listed elsewhere. In this section, you can include personal projects, open-source contributions, school projects (if you’re just starting out), and projects from your previous employers. With each project, mention the problem you were faced with, the solution you devised, and what programming languages and tools you used to solve it. </h1>
